Description

This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc. As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc. To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics. With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.

# I. Prerequisites
  
  As the project uses minilibx library, its requires X11 library

# II. How to run the program

  'make' to compile the program
  $ ./cub3d <map_path/file.cub> to run the program
  $ ./cub3d <map_path/file.cub> --save to save the first rendered image as a bitmap

# III. The Game

  Key comands to move around the maze
  W A S D to move the point of view
  Left/Right (←/→) directional keys to rotate the camera
  M to show/hide the mini 2d map
  ESC to quit
